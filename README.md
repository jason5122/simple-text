## About

> [!NOTE]
> The app name and icon are a placeholder!

Simple Text is a fast, lightweight text editor written in C++ and OpenGL. The goal of this project is to provide a competitive editing experience to that of VSCode and Zed with a fraction of the code size. It should also be easy to extend and hack on the internals.

Simple Text also doubles as a research project on font rendering, GUI frameworks, computer graphics, and text editing.
